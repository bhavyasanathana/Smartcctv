# CCTV Detection System

## Description
This project is a CCTV-based detection system designed to monitor video footage and detect activity in real time.
It uses computer vision techniques to analyze CCTV camera input and identify objects or motion for surveillance purposes.

## Features
- Real-time CCTV video monitoring
- Detection of movement or objects in the camera feed
- Frame-by-frame video analysis
- Alerts or visual indication when detection occurs
- Works with live camera or recorded video

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Computer Vision concepts

## How It Works
1. Captures video input from a CCTV camera or video file
2. Processes each frame using computer vision techniques
3. Detects activity or objects based on predefined logic
4. Displays detection results on the video feed

## How to Run
1. Install required libraries:
   pip install opencv-python numpy

2. Run the program:
   python main.py

3. Ensure the CCTV camera or video file is properly connected.

## Use Cases
- Security surveillance
- Intrusion detection
- Monitoring restricted areas
- Academic and learning purposes

## Future Enhancements
- Face recognition integration
- Alert system using email or SMS
- Cloud-based storage for detected events
- AI-based behavior analysis
